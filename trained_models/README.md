# Pretrained Icon Classification Models

This folder contains pretrained models for icon classification. We have trained many classifiers, but for the sake of simplicity, we are only uploading the top 2 performing models to Dropbox.

## Accessing the Pretrained Models

To access the pretrained models, follow these steps:

1. Click on the following Dropbox links to access the model files:
   - [Top-Performing Model 1](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pglf8zddtq0iwy16b4xz8/resnet_20_51_80.h5?rlkey=cf85jef8lz1bug1k9ux9bp6u5&dl=0)
   - [Top-Performing Model 2](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8kzjxr30ze2lvr0f2uhd3/mobilenet_50_51_128.h5?rlkey=n3bwf1zm83vxlpitk80zj2chj&dl=0)

2. Once you are on the Dropbox pages for each model, you can download the model files.

## Model Details

You can test the best-performing model by providing the path of an icon to be predicted as a command-line argument to the [resnet_single.py](https://github.com/cemaly/AdapTV/blob/main/resnet_single.py) script.
